title: About me 
---

Hi! I'm Joanne. I'm currently a software engineer at [Plaid](https://plaid.com).
I graduated from MIT in 2019, and before that I went to a [boarding high
school for nerds](https://imsa.edu).

In non-covid times, I like to indoor climb and spend time with friends. These
days, I am trying to get better at singing, playing guitar, and biking.

I'm hoping to write more, so if you don't see new stuff here for a bit, that's
me slacking. I apologize in advance.
